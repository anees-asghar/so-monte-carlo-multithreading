# Operating Systems Project: Monte Carlo simulation using multithreading
For this project, our task was to employ the Monte Carlo method to estimate the value of pi by utilizing a range of arbitrary points. Additionally, we were required to evaluate the impact of using different numbers of threads on the program's performance for each number of arbitrary points.

The command to compile solution.c file is `gcc -pthread solution.c -lm`
